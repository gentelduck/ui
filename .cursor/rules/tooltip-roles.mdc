# Cursor Rule Tooltip

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a high-performance tooltip system, similar to Radix UI, but optimized for performance and usability. The tooltip should:

- Be lightweight and fast
- Minimize re-renders
- Use native event listeners efficiently
- Provide accessible ARIA attributes
- Support delay and position control

## Resoureces
  - https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/tree/main/packages/react/tooltip
  - @hay.tsx


## Rules
  - Do not use `js` to handle the animation on hover make it with `tailwindcss`.
  - Refactor the `tooltipo arrow` to be sudo element `::after` to the `TooltipContent`.
  - Reduce the code written to reduce the bundle size of the component.
  - Fix the animation with transform origin the center the direction.
