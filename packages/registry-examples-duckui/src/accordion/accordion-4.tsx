          Is it accessible?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Yes. This accordion is built following the WAI-ARIA design patterns to
          ensure accessibility for users with disabilities. Each trigger is
          keyboard-navigable, and the content is properly associated with its
          trigger for screen readers. This makes it usable across a wide range
          of devices and assistive technologies.

          Is it styled?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Yes. The accordion comes with a modern and clean default styling that
          seamlessly integrates with other UI components in the registry. You
          can also customize the styles with utility classes or by overriding
          the default class names, ensuring it matches the aesthetic of your
          application.

        >
          Is it animated?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Yes. By default, the accordion includes smooth and responsive
          animations for expanding and collapsing content. These animations
          provide a visually appealing user experience, while also making the
          state transitions more intuitive. If you prefer, the animations can be
          disabled or replaced with your own custom effects.

          How customizable is it?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          The accordion is highly customizable. You can modify its behavior,
          appearance, and animations through props, custom styles, and utility
          classes. Whether you need to adjust the spacing, colors, or even
          change the way it functions, the accordion is designed to be flexible
          and adaptable to your project's needs.
